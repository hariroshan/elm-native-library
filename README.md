# Elm Native

Build mobile apps with elm using NativeScript API. `elm/http` works with this library as well!

We can build simple apps like counter

![Counter](./doc/counter.gif)

or something like a blog

or even complex app with page transitions, modals, dialog, and much more!

## TODO

1. Write docs for attributes
2. Convert raw js into rescript
3. Build a starter template with elm support with bindings pre-installed
4. Extract and publish elm-native in elm and elm-native-js in npm/yarn
5. Support animations
6. Split project into different modules, publish library in elm and npm
7. Use taskport to build typesafe nativescipt api calls.
